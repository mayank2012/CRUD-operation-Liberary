Node.js + Express power a CRUD API for library management. Create & manage books (read, update, delete). Mongoose simplifies database interactions. Routes handle each operation (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) with error handling. Security considerations include input validation and authentication. Deploy and test for a robust solution.

Run API Tests using Postman.
